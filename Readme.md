Duo is a next-generation package manager that blends the best ideas from [Component](https://github.com/component/component), [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) and [Go](http://golang.org/) to make organizing and writing front-end code quick and painless.

## Features

  1. has first-class support for Javascript, HTML and CSS
  2. exposes a unix-y command line interface
  3. pulls source directly from GitHub with semantic versioning
  4. supports source transforms, like Coffeescript or Sass
  5. does not require a manifest


## Installation

Install Duo straight from `npm` with:

```
$ npm install -g duo
```

## Getting Started

To get started just write normal Javascript, requiring dependencies straight from the file system or from GitHub as you need them:

```js
var uid = require('matthewmueller/uid');
var fmt = require('yields/fmt');

var msg = fmt('Your unique ID is %s!', uid());
window.alert(msg);
```

Then use `duo` to install your dependencies and build your file:

```
$ duo index.js
```

Finally, drop a single `<script>` onto your page and you're done!

```html
<script src="build/index.js"></script>
```

Same goes for CSS! You can require dependencies and assets from the file system or straight from GitHub:

```css
@import 'necolas/normalize.css';

body {
  color: teal;
  background: url('./background-image.jpg');
}
```

Then bundle up your CSS with `duo`:

```
$ duo index.css
```

And add your bundled-up stylesheet to your page!

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="build/index.css">
```

## Authenticate with Github

We recommend that you authenticate with Github so you can increase your rate limit and allow you to pull from private repositories. To do that, add the following entry to your `~/.netrc` file:

    machine api.github.com
      login <username>
      password <token>

You can create a new `token` here: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

## Debugging

If you run into an issue with Duo, often times you can resolve it by prepending `DEBUG=duo*` to your `$COMMAND`:

```bash
$ DEBUG=duo* $COMMAND
```

Example:

```bash
$ DEBUG=duo* duo index.js
```

If you can't figure it out, you should open an issue: https://github.com/duojs/duo/issues

## Test

Download this repository and run:

```bash
make test
```
